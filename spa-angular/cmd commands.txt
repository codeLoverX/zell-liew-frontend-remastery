npx create-new-app uses store/ cache a lot taking huge amounts of time for (p)npm install
// Even for pnpm run this
npm cache clean --force
pnpm store prune
pnpx nest new server
ng new tour-heroes --skip-install
cd tour-heroes
rimraf node_modules
ng config cli.packageManager pnpm
pnpm install --shamefully-hoist
ng serve --open

Don't remove the .pnpm-store folder. Only remove node_modules if you want to.
Try to run pnpm install --shamefully-hoist. If it helps, you can create a .npmrc
file in the root of your project with shamefully-hoist=true.
The issue is that pnpm creates a strict node_modules and sometimes packages require other 
packages that are not declared in their package.json. See pnpmâ€™s strictness helps to avoid silly bugs
